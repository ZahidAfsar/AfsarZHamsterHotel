// Peer comment : Site works and functions perfectly fine
// Perfectly identical to prototype site in terms of layout and design
// Well Responsive and can scale well to medium resolutions, although lower resolutions cause elements to offset
// Great implementation of dropdown when in mobile resolution, although also can end up being offset away from view
// Some image elements dont have the 'object-fit: cover' thus can cause stretching even when unzoomed
// Otherwise, the website is on point
